                    <h1>Why Flexbox?</h1>
                </header>
                <p>For a long time, the only reliable cross browser-compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts
                    were things like floats and positioning. These are fine and they work, but in some ways they are
                    also rather limiting and frustrating.</p>
                <p>The following simple layout requirements are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such
                    tools, in any kind of convenient, flexible way:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.</li>
                    <li>Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height,
                        regardless of how much width/height is available.</li>
                    <li>Making all columns in a multiple column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a
                        different amount of content.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As you'll see in subsequent sections, flexbox makes a lot of layout tasks much easier. Let's dig in!</p>

            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id='An_aside_on_the_flex_model'>
                <header class="main__header">
                    <h1>An aside on the flex model</h1>
                </header>

                <p>
                    When elements are laid out as flexible boxes, they are laid out along two axes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The main axis is the axis running in the direction the flex items are being laid out in (e.g.
                        as
                        rows across the page, or columns down the page.) The start and end of this axis are called the
                        main
                        start and main end.</li>
                    <li>The cross axis is the axis running perpendicular to the direction the flex items are being laid
                        out
                        in. The start and end of this axis are called the cross start and cross end.</li>
                    <li>The parent element that has <code>display: flex</code> set on it (the <code>&ltsection&gt</code>
                        in our example) is called the flex container.</li>
                    <li>The items being laid out as flexible boxes inside the flex container are called flex items (the
                        <code>&ltsection&gt</code> elements in our example).</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id='Columns_or_rows?'>
                <header class="main__header">
                    <h1>Columns or rows?</h1>
                </header>
                <p>Flexbox provides a property called <code>flex-direction</code> that specifies what direction the
                    main
                    axis runs in (what direction the flexbox children are laid out in) — by default this is set to<code> row </code>,
                    which causes them to be laid out in a row in the direction your browser's default language works in
                    (left to right, in the case of an English browser).</p>

                <p>Try adding the following declaration to your section rule:</p>

                <code>
                <ol>
                  <li> flex-direction: column; </li>
                </ol>
            </code>

                <p>You'll see that this puts the items back in a column layout, much like they were before we added any
                    CSS. Before you move on, delete this declaration from your example.</p>

            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id='flex-flow_shorthand'>
                <header class="main__header">
                    <h1>flex-flow shorthand</h1>
                </header>
                <p>
                    At this point it is worth noting that a shorthand exists for <code>flex-direction</code> and <code>flex-wrap</code>
                    — <code>flex-flow</code>. So for example, you can replace

                    <code>
                        <ol>
                            <li>flex-direction: row;</li>
                            <li>flex-wrap: wrap;</li>
                        </ol>
                    </code>
                    <p>with</p>
                    <code>
                        <ol>
                            <li>flex-flow: row wrap;</li>
                        </ol>
                    </code>
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id='flex:_shorthand_versus_longhand'>
                <header class="main__header">
                    <h1>flex: shorthand versus longhand</h1>
                </header>
                <p> <code>flex</code> is a shorthand property that can specify up to three different values:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The unitless proportion value we discussed above. This can be specified individually using the
                        <code>flex-grow</code> longhand property.</li>
                    <li>A second unitless proportion value — <code>flex-shrink</code> — that comes into play when the
                        flex
                        items are overflowing their container. This specifies how much of the overflowing amount is
                        taken
                        away from each flex item's size, to stop them overflowing their container. This is quite an
                        advanced flexbox feature, and we won't be covering it any further in this article.</li>
                    <li>The minimum size value we discussed above. This can be specified individually using the <code>flex-basis</code>
                        longhand value.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We'd advise against using the longhand flex properties unless you really have to (for example, to
                    override something previously set). They lead to a lot of extra code being written, and they can be
                    somewhat confusing.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id='Ordering_flex_items'>
                <header class="main__header">
                    <h1>Ordering flex items</h1>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Flexbox also has a feature for changing the layout order of flex items, without affecting the
                    source
                    order. This is another thing that is impossible to do with traditional layout methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The code for this is simple: try adding the following CSS to your button bar example code:
                </p>
                <code>
                         <ol>
                             <li>button:first-child {</li>
                             <li>  order: 1;</li>
                             <li>}</li>
                        </ol>
                 </code>
                <p>Refresh, and you'll now see that the "Smile" button has moved to the end of the main axis. Let's
                    talk
                    about how this works in a bit more detail:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>By default, all flex items have an order value of 0.</li>
                    <li>Flex items with higher order values set on them will appear later in the display order than
                        items
                        with lower order values.</li>
                    <li>Flex items with the same order value will appear in their source order. So if you have four
                        items
                        with order values of 2, 1, 1, and 0 set on them respectively, their display order would be 4th,
                        2nd, 3rd, then 1st.</li>
                    <li>The 3rd item appears after the 2nd because it has the same order value and is after it in the
                        source order.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You can set negative order values to make items appear earlier than items with 0 set. For example,
                    you
                    could make the "Blush" button appear at the start of the main axis using the following rule:
                </p>

                <code>
                    <ol>
                        <li>button:last-child {</li>
                        <li> order: -1;</li>
                        <li>}</li>
                    </ol>
                </code>
